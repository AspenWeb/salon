## Contributing to Aspen

Thanks for your interest! We have a number of [repos](https://github.com/AspenWeb), and we welcome pull requests for any of them. If you have questions that don't fit neatly in any one repo, ask here in [the salon](https://github.com/AspenWeb/aspen.py/issues/new).

Here's a really bad photo of a model of our repos:

That has all our present repos on it, along with a couple that don't exist yet: **Dispatcher** and **Simplates** (underlined). The two question marks are on **Standalone** (which also doesn't exist yet) and [**Core**](https://github.com/AspenWeb/aspen.py). Off to the left are the [**rb**](https://github.com/AspenWeb/aspen.rb), [**js**](https://github.com/AspenWeb/aspen.js), and [**go**](https://github.com/AspenWeb/aspen.go) repos—stubby ports of Aspen from Python to other languages. Hovering around Simplates on the right are the [**Vim**](https://github.com/AspenWeb/simplate.vim), [**Emacs**](https://github.com/AspenWeb/simplates.emacs), and [**.org**](https://github.com/AspenWeb/simplates.org) repos related to that. It's too faint to see, but there are dotted lines from [**Plugins**](https://github.com/AspenWeb/aspen.py-plugins) (hovering near Core) that go to Standalone, Core, and Simplates—where are we offering pluggability, exactly? [**Algorithm**](https://github.com/AspenWeb/algorithm.py) and [**Dependency Injection**](https://github.com/AspenWeb/dependency_injection.py) are factored out below Core. [**Filesystem Tree**](https://github.com/AspenWeb/filesystem_tree.py) is floating at the bottom (which project[s] are using it for tests? I forget). [**Salon**](https://github.com/AspenWeb/salon) encompasses the whole.
